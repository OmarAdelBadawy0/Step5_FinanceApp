## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Step5th follows **Google’s recommended modern Android architecture**, ensuring scalability, testability, and maintainability:

```
Presentation Layer (Jetpack Compose UI)
        ↓
Domain Layer (Use Cases & Business Logic)
        ↓
Data Layer (Repositories, APIs, and DTOs)
```

Each layer communicates through clearly defined interfaces and dependency injection with **Hilt**, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
